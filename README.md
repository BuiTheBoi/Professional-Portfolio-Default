# Professional Portfolio

To learn front-end development, I created a professional website using HTML, CSS, and
JavaScript to describe who I am and what I do. This website also gives basic contact
information such as my GitHub, LinkedIn, and Gmail.

I can only show so much through my resume, so making an entire website with colors and
pictures gives even more insight of who I am to employers.
